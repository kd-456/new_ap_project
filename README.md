##Stick Hero Game Project
This project is part of our AP course and involves implementing a game inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The game emulates the core mechanics of Stick Hero while incorporating creative additions to enhance gameplay.

In this project, We developed a game where a character named Stick-Hero traverses between platforms by stretching out a stick. The goal is to collect cherries while reaching the next platform. The game challenges players to time their stick extension correctly to avoid falling into the abyss.
